At this moment, there is no stable bundles available.

However, some experimental _all-in-one_ builds, which include [twister-core](https://github.com/twisterarmy/twister-core) and [twister-html](https://github.com/twisterarmy/twister-html) for desktop use, are available from the community.

## Flatpak

The best option if you want to try twister p2p from the sandbox, without compiling the build.
